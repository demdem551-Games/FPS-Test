FPS Test is a Free To Play, Modable game (DLCs might be paid) where you use your very epic (ok you might not be that good) FPS gaming power to fight with Friends, AI and Online with random people! But to unlock those you need to do the prologue (gtaV reference) A.K.A the tutorial.

Anyways enough about the game. Its time for a tutorial on how to mod it!

(Not done yet lol)
